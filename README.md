The purpose of this project is to show the well-known link between a country's GDP and energy consumption per capita; that higher-income countries consume more energy and thus emit more greenhouse gases than other countries

The colour of a country is used to show the energy per capita (in kWh), and the size of the scatter dots correlates to the country's GDP per capita (in USD)

To use, clone repo and run>python plotly_map.py
